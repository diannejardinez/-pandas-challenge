The three observable trends based on the data look into the gender and age demographics, and the most profitable item purchases.
1. Of the players who purchased and that declared their gender, 45 percent where men and 15 percent were women
2. The top three age ranges that purchased game items were:  20 to 24(late Gen Z/early Millennials), 15 to 19(Gen Z), and 25 to 29(Millennials). 
3. The most purchased game item was the “Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm” that is currently priced at $4.23 and had a total of 12 purchasing instances with the “Nirvana” as the second most purchased.


The data that I am interested in obtaining after looking at this dataset is whether or not there would be a difference in most purchases of game items if game items were sold as a package but at a higher price. For example packaging the top 2 purchased items together, such as the “Oathbreaker” and “Nirvana” from this dataset at a price higher or creating a new game item that acts similar to the top two most purchased items.
